# Ethan Johnson
Hi, I'm a Computer Engineering student in Wright State University's 4+1 B.S./M.S. program with a focus on digital and embedded systems.

# Work
I work as an IT intern at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), supporting Department of Defense (DoD) high-performance computing (HPC) systems. I contribute to system administration work using Red Hat Enterprise Linux as well as HPC network automation using Ansible

## Projects
Some projects I'm working on include:

1. HPC system usage metrics: this projects involves data analysis via the OpenSearch Python API to visualize hardware usage on HPC systems. This includes memory, CPU, and GPU usage, alongside other metrics.
2. Arch Linux configuration: as I continue configuring my home desktop running Arch Linux, I plan to track my progress with GitHub. This will assist with version control and possible integration with future setups.

## Tools
I'm currently learning Bash and Python scripting, along with C and C++ development for embedded software development (Arduino and Raspberry Pi)

## Courses
My fall 2025 semester schedule includes: Microprocessor-based Embedded Systems, Operating System Usage, Electronic Devices/Circuits, and Team Projects I
